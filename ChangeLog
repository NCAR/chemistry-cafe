Reactions can now be assigned to Sections in the edit/clone/add area of kinetics and photolysis
WRF Custom Rates are now assigable in the edit/clone/add area of kinetics and photolysis

When user assigns no wrf rate to kinetics, the user interface shows "--- USE CESM RATE ---"

Modification of reactions carries wrf-rates forward.  I hope I caught all these exceptional cases!
Modification of reactions carries sections forward.

If CESM label is usr_*  then cesm rate constants are set to null.

Infrastructure: kinetics/photolysis editing data is now placed in a javascript "formData" array
